{"bio":"My mission is to get you, the reader educated on all that is important in life. For with this gift of knowledge you will live a more fufilling live both spiritually and metaphyiscally. My desire to educate the general public first came about when I was traveling in this town called Sri Kava near the Himalayas. Naturally. By this point in my life I had been researching all things spiritual and non-physical and was starting to discover what the world was and how its vibrations comunicated with me. In the town I had saw a starving child who kept saying that he was hungry. But I knew what he really needed, spiritual knowledge! With proper spiritual knowledge I know that the kid could have survived with a few simple thoughts such as \"Everything we eat is living, is it a cruel world\" or \"Is this hunger or just a fabric of my immagination?\". From that day on I would continue my spiritual journey but at the same time start this blog so that you all can become educated with me and see the world through an enlightened stance. I hope you feel enlightened, young cricket."}
